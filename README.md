# Open Source ThreeJS Strategy Game

## Contribution

This is pretty much a hobby project as it is interesting to play around with 'visual' programming.

Contributions to this project like [Discussions and Ideas](https://github.com/superstes/game/discussions) are very welcome.

It is and will always be Open-Source!

Some Ideas are:
* To create a strategy game that can be played in the browser.
* Either by running a local/dedicated server or just joining an official one.
* It should always be playable offline.
* Single and Multiplayer Options.
* Gameplay:
  * Should stay pretty simple for beginnings.
  * Inspirations: Civilization, The Settlers, Banished, Risk-Game, Total War Medieval 2, Crusader Kings 2, ...
